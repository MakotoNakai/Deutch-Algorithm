# Deutch-Jozsa Algorithm
Deutch-Jozza algorithm is a one of the simplest quantum algorithm that solves a particular problem faster than its classical counterpart.  

## Problem that this algorithm aims to solve  
Suppose that there is a binary function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f(x)" title="f(x)" />, and
